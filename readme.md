## Official Implementation of "UniTS: A Universal Time Series Analysis Framework with Self-supervised Representation Learning".
UniTS is a powerful framework for time series analysis that incorporates self-supervised representation learning to address practical challenges such as partial labeling and domain shift. With UniTS, users can easily perform analysis tasks using user-friendly GUIs and benefit from its convenience. The components of UniTS are designed with sklearn-like APIs, allowing for flexible extensions. This project's GitHub repository provides access to the UniTS framework and related resources.
